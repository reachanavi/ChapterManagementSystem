# ChapterManagementSystem
I created a chapter management system for the international nonprofit ProjectCSGIRLS that allows the ProjectCSGIRLS management team to visualize and keep track of the progress of numerous global chapters. It works with Google Sheets API to automatically assign and organize new chapter applications to team members. This project was also submitted to the International Baccalaureate Computer Science Higher Level Internal Assessment.

Instructions for running on a local machine:
1. Navigate the folder containing the project in your computer's terminal/command line and paste the following text into the terminal to start a local server: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
2.  Paste the following link into your browser to view the web application: http://localhost:8000
3. If this is your first time running the program, click the Authorize button on the left side of the screen and log in with any Google account. The browser may warn you that the application is unsafe because it is not published, but you can bypass these warnings and say that you want to continue to QuickStart.
4. Once you have successfully logged in to your Google Account and allowed it the permissions requested, you will be directed back to the application, and the tables will be filled with the correct data.
